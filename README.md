# co2Sequestration
Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) has been proposed as a promising and necessary technology for mitigating CO2 and the effects of anthropogenic climate change. Deep geological formations, like saline aquifers, are pointed out as promising areas for large-scale storage of CO2. If CCS is implemented on large scale to make noticeable reductions in atmospheric CO2, then it will require a solid scientific foundation defining the coupled hydrologic–geochemical–geomechanical processes that govern the long-term fate of CO2 in the subsurface, migration behavior of CO2, trapping mechanisms, proper utilization of methods to characterize and select sequestration sites, workflow and evaluation process, simulation methods, subsurface engineering to optimize performance, well placement, injection rate and cost, approaches to ensure safe operation, monitoring technology, remediation methods, regulatory overview, and an institutional approach for managing long-term liability. To address the above issues, we demonstrated, reviewed and developed the overall workflow of the process of   CO2 sequestration in this study.
